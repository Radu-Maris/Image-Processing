In each lab I implemented a new functionality:

Lab 1:
  * Add/substract gray levels of an image
  * Creating a color image and divide it into 4 color squares

Lab 2:
  * Color spaces
  * Separating the RGB chanels
  * Conversion from RGB to Grayscale
  * Conversion from RGB to HSV

Lab3:
  * Computation of the Hystogram of a grayscale image
  * Computation of the normalized Hystogram
  * Multi-Level Tresholding
  * Floyd-Steinberg dithering

Lab 4:
  * Area computation
  * Center of mass
  * Axis of elongation
  * Perimeter
  * Thinness ratio (circularity)
  * Aspect Ratio
  * Horizontal and Vertical projection


Lab 5:
  * Color image from a label matrix
  * Step by step visualisation of the previous implementation
  * Two-pass component labeling alghorithm
